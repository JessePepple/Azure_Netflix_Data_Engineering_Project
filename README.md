This project implemented Unity Catalog in Databricks for secure, centralized data governance, while leveraging Delta Lake and Delta Tables for scalable, efficient storage. The data pipeline followed the Medallion Architecture (Bronze → Silver → Gold), ensuring data quality, reliability, and usability at every stage. The solution utilized Azure Data Factory, Azure SQL Database, Azure Data Lake Storage, and Azure Databricks also finalised with Delta Live Tables as a automated pipeline tool for serving our data in the SQL Datawarehouse for analytic and reporting, with Python and SQL for data transformation and scripting.
